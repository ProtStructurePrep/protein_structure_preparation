Protein-Ligand Complex MD simulations
=================
The aim of this repository is facilitate the MD simulations procedure. It contains the basic steps for parsing proteins and selecting its ligands. Also, you can find the steps for preparing the protein and ligands, by fixing errors in their PDB files. After this first part of parsing and fixing erros, you will find the steps for simulating the protein and the protein-ligand complex.

For a better understanding of the different functionalities of this program you can use this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1x0s3Ui5VQVVR1Esj5_JbqmH5w-PkJGl5?usp=sharing). Here you will find an example pipeline to get familiar with the program.
